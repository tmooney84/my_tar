To-Do Friday 2/13/25

process_entry:
bugs??? >>> I think the tar file should be able to be extracted with tar
//likely need to change the file name and make sure that the logic for my_tar output is identical to tar output

build out -cf 
make sure that it is differentiated from -rt and overwrites everything if the file already exists

build out -rf
make sure that it adds to the end

build out -uf

build out -tf 
-use the ustar a certain location to find tar file
-from there locate the name using standard format

build out -xf
1) Read header (512 bytes).
2) Extract filename (name field).
3) Check typeflag (if it's '0', it's a file).
4) Create a new file using open(name, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, mode).
5) Read size bytes from tar and write to the file.
6) Skip padding (to next 512-byte boundary).
7) Restore metadata (mode, timestamps).

-use the ustar to build file name
-restore meta data (look to chatgpt list for mode, date modified)
